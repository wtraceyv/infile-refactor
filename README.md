# infile-refactor

Now in GUI form!

Really good for rectifying resource paths in Godot scripts.
Run with python3, don't know about compatibility with anything earlier.

### Usage

To install, just run `git clone https://github.com/wtraceyv/infile-refactor.git` and use the included .py files.

 To use, run 
 
 `python3 refactor-gui.py`
 
 or
 
 `python3 refactor-cmd.py`
 
 For the cmd version, it will search the directory it is in, or you can supply a root directory like 
 
`python3 refactor.py ../git/project`.

### Dependencies

This is not compiled to anything for an OS, you must have python3 and pyside6 via pip for the gui.
