# infile-refactor

Current only a cmd version, may work on a simple visual version later.
Really good for rectifying resource paths in Godot scripts.
Run with python3, don't know about compatibility with anything earlier.

### Usage

To install, just run `git clone https://github.com/wtraceyv/infile-refactor.git` and use the included .py file.

 To use, run 
 
 `python3 refactor.py` 
 
 with the file in the target directory, or supply a root directory like 
 
`python3 refactor.py ../git/project`.
